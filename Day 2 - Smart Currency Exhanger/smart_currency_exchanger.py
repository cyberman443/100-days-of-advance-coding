{Fore.RED}\tYour personal assistant for making smart and profitable currency exchange decisions!{Fore.RESET}
{Fore.GREEN}\tBased on the latest 1-week exchange rate trends, \n\twe'll help you decide which currency to exchange your base currency into, \n\tfor the best potential return on your investment.{Fore.RESET}
{Fore.BLUE}\t--------------------------------------------------
{Fore.RED}\tHow it works:{Fore.RESET}
{Fore.GREEN}\t1. You input your base currency (e.g., USD).{Fore.RESET}
{Fore.GREEN}\t2. We'll fetch the latest 1-week historical data for exchange rates.{Fore.RESET}
{Fore.GREEN}\t3. Based on trends and volatility, we provide you with our smart recommendation!{Fore.RESET}

{Fore.RED}\tDue to the fact that the API used in this applications only provides historical data for the base currency of Dollar, 
\tthus, our robot can only handle dollar base - Therefore, you should only enter [1] for Dollar, choosing your currency.
\tBut you can improve this code by subscribing to the openexchangerates.org's developer or enterprise accounts.{Fore.RESET}
