### Overview

The **Brand Name Generator** is a Python-based application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model that helps users generate creative, catchy, and unique brand names based on their input. The app prompts the user for key information such as **keywords**, **business type**, **themes**, **target audience**, and **location**, and then uses GPT-3 to generate a list of highly relevant brand names, each with an explanation of why it's a good fit for the brand.

The application is designed to be interactive and visually appealing, using **ANSI escape sequences** to add color to the terminal output, making it more engaging for the user.
